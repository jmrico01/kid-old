- Generate ground from PSD layer with single loop
	1. Find inner boundary of image region "outside" loop (paint-bucket ish)
	2. Find outer boundary of image region "inside" loop
	3. We get 2 lines that surround the ground. Somehow average/smooth them.
	4. $$$

- Generate collision platforms from PSD layers
	* Same idea as above, but we only need inner boundary, because it's 1 line
