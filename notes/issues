Issues:

Make airborne horizontal control more realistic / physics-y
    - Preserve horizontal velocity during jump, with v limited break capability

Delay of jump (do only 1 frame of buildup)
Unresponsiveness of jump right after landing

Jump height/speed is scaled by holding space bar. Do the same for falling
