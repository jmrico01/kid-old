0. facility, get suited up, briefed, etc.
1. port in to kidz world, appear somewhere in the sky. fall down (planes, birds, clouds)
2. splashdown, sink to the bottom of the ocean. submarine to the left, blocked, must walk right
3. vertical water surface, first curve approaches. keep walking, world turns, you come out to land
4. snow biome. there's an ingloo and a mining dude, a rock at the far right that blocks you.
5. dude likes to mine things. you can grab him, take him to rock, and he will break it.
6. you traverse the curve to the right and approach the town.
7. it's extremely hot, the sun loves the smell of some lady's food coming out of the house. he's floating there - everyone is very bothered and can't go on with their lives in peace.

after this, there will hopefully be several possible sequences events

> freeze somebody


> sad tony
- sad guy with cloud following him
1. you grab him, move him to town.
2. put him on top of crops, cloud rains on them, they grow.
3. move tony right below the sun, cloud vanishes, "sad" gets crossed out, he's ok again.

> farmer guy
- crops are all dried up, not enough water, too hot.
- can't go upstairs in his house, he's sitting there depressed and watching the stairway.
- when you water crops with sad tony's cloud, he goes outside and you can inspect his bedroom.
- TODO there's something useful in his bedroom

> lab
- guys are plotting something, they need the Governor.
- they can't show up in town because everyone knows them, they'll be captured/killed. they already sent one of their guys but he disappeared. they have his notes on what was happening for a few days.
- they need you to lure out Governor and bring him.
- they give you Rusty Key to start the mission??

> TRANSITION. Governor + wife (requires Rusty Key)
- wife downstairs cooking, can't be picked up (smacks you with a pan/pot).
- there's a big pot, the source of the good smell, going up chimney and keeping the sun there.
- Governor upstairs / in locked room, inaccessible. watching TV.
1. shut down the generator/antenna/something outside that disconnects the TV.
2. Governor comes downstairs and outside with a bat, "AHORA SI CAREPICHA"
3/opt1. Governor doesn't see you, turns generator back on, goes back inside to watch TV. fin.
3/opt2. you pick up Governor, wife starts chasing you with a pan, the whole town goes crazy.
4. you take Governor away to the lab people, they drag him away, the town hates you. you can't come back.

| ... something something ...

5. you cross around the ocean, come back to snow biome.
6. you enter unseen to the town, get the wife's pot, and take the sun away into the snow.
7. everyone starts chasing you. scene is perfectly timed so that you have just enough time to melt the snow and drag the boat to the shore.
8. you leave wife and pitchfork town people behind on the shore and sail away.
- awkward possibilities of Governor chase scene:
	- mob starts chasing you, there's a guy with a pitchfork in front. you have to stay some distance away from him or he'll kill you
	- if you drop Governor on the way,  

> SECRET ENDING
- there's a way (idk how yet) to take the Governor past his wife and into the snow.
1. shut down generator, Governor comes outside, you pick him up, take him to the snow.
2. the wife and whole village follows you, they walk out into the snow and all freeze.
3. you can now grab the pot and bring the sun over, sail away.

RANDOM NOTES
- sun's face is randomized?
- choppy animations, low framerates. will that ever matter to gameplay? vs. foreign high-framerate
